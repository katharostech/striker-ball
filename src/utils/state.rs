//! To use the states just install the [`StatePlugin`] into the session you want the states to be updated in.
//!
//! The [`State`] component contains a [`Ustr`] for the state id and data for the number of frames the current
//! state has been active.
//!
//! Installing the [`StatePlugin`] adds a [`SystemStage`] to your [`Session`] under the label [`StateStage`]
//! that runs before [`CoreStage::PreUpdate`].
//!
//! The systems under [`StateStage`] run several times if needed to ensure that the states finish
//! all their potential transitions in one frame without delays that could cause presumably impossible
//! game scenarios.
//!
//! Since the systems can potentially run multiple times the majority of your mutations should change only
//! [`State::current`] and few other necessary state transition related changes to avoid the transition
//! loop getting stuck in an infinite loop.
